            <h2>Courses/Program</h2>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Business and Technology Management (BTM) program, 
                with a minor in Computer Science. 
                I am looking forward to diving into web design in one of my upcoming classes! 
                While I have a keen interest in computer science, I also enjoy the business aspects, 
                which is why I chose the BTM program over a full Computer Science major.</p>
            <h3>Most Useful Course</h3>
            <p>The CPS 109 course I took has been my most useful course as it taught me
                the basics of python which I have used to expanded my programming skills and 
                has let me learn how to program projects I desire.
